# Excursion - Website for a fictitious travel app
The goal of this project is to train HTML & CSS by building a static landing page for the fictitious app "Excursion".

The project is part of the web development learning path from Codecademy. It is the first off-platform project in my learning journey that brings together the usage of **HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub**.
