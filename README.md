# Excursion - Website for a fictitious travel app
The goal of this project is to train HTML & CSS by building a static landing page for the fictitious app "Excursion".

The project is part of the web development learning path from Codecademy. It is the first off-platform project in my learning journey that brings together the usage of **HTML, CSS, Git and GitHub**.

The result fulfills all requirements from the exercise. However optional advancements could be reasonable (see next section).

## Next steps
- Check if the code is clean - clean it up, if needed
- Replace `<div>` with semantic tags
- Integrate advanced CSS styling
